# :warning: CURRENTLY NOT WORKING :warning:
Users have reported this not working and I dont own this printer anymore. 

## :warning: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :warning:
Just to cover my ass

# Flashforge-for-Cura
This profile is able to be used with the Flashforge Creator Pro The lack of heating gcodes in the start script is BY design! If you put the temps into the gcode then both will heat up everytime you use the printer not just the side being used.

PLEASE NOTE AS OF RIGHT NOW THE MAX DOESNT WORK


## How to install
Just download the master zip and drop the files into your cura install folder NOT THE APPDATA (You need admin access) 

OR
**use the installer under the releases section of GitHub (reccomended)**.
This will add the flashforge printer to your cura add printer under the Flashforge tab you have to install the GPX plugin to make it work

# Recommendation
Always make sure that you have a skirt around your print because this profile doesnt have a purge of the nozzle.
